About:
This 'Gothic Sprite Fonts' asset pack contains lots of sprite sheets that can be used to draw texts in Game Maker.

All sheets are included as 'Included files' in the Gamemaker project. Some of the sprite sheets are created as sprites and an draw object in the project is used to illustrate how to draw text using the sprites as a font.

License:
Purchasing the asset pack will allow you to use the assets in not only one but in all commercial games, you ever make. 
You may not sell, re-sell, distribute, reproduce or make any other use of the asset other that using them in games you create.
